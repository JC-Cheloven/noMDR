analysis of structures with complicated nodes - 2D 

This program only defines the behavior equations of the bars of the structure.
Any relationship between the parameters (forces, moments, displacements,
flexure angles) of the extreme points of the bars are to be provided by the 
user as linear equations. This provides maximum flexibility for the modelling
of unusual connections (may barely be understood as "nodes"), such as
bars contacting with other bars, hinges conecting rigid bars in some 
midle point, relatioships involving remote extreme points and so on.

The author expects noMDR to be useful for you!
